# Database of PPG Signals for Blood Pressure Analysis and Estimation

This repository was created to function from a web page. You can access the page and its content at the following link: https://the-juanjo.github.io/Database-of-PPG-Signals-for-Blood-Pressure-Analysis-and-Estimation/

# Some terms to consider for better understanding the information on the website:

1.	Subject: It's a unique identifier for each individual in the study.
2.	Age: The age of the subject in years.
3.	Gender: The gender of the subject, which can be male or female.
4.	Diagnosis: Indicates whether the subject has been diagnosed with any relevant medical condition, as seen in the example, "YES" indicates they have been diagnosed, while "NO" indicates otherwise.
5.	Treatment: Indicates whether the subject is receiving medical treatment for the diagnosed condition. "YES" means they are receiving treatment, "NO" means otherwise.
6.	JNC: Refers to the Joint National Committee (JNC) guidelines on the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure (hypertension). Possible values are pre-hypertension, "Normotensive" for normal blood pressure, and hypertension.
7.	AHA: Stands for the American Heart Association (AHA), and similarly to the JNC, it indicates the subject's cardiovascular health status.
8.	Systolic BP: The subject's systolic blood pressure, measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).
9.	Diastolic BP: The subject's diastolic blood pressure, also measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).
10.	Heart Rate: The subject's heart rate, measured in beats per minute (bpm).
Classification Ranges according to JNC and AHA

# Joint National Committee (JNC):

1.	Pre-hypertension: Systolic blood pressure between 120-139 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure between 80-89 mmHg.
2.	Normal blood pressure: Systolic blood pressure less than 120 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure less than 80 mmHg.
   
3.	Hypertension:
•	Stage 1: Systolic blood pressure between 140-159 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure between 90-99 mmHg.
•	Stage 2: Systolic blood pressure equal to or greater than 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure equal to or greater than 100 mmHg.

# American Heart Association (AHA):

1.	Normal blood pressure: Systolic blood pressure less than 120 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure less than 80 mmHg.
2.	Elevated blood pressure: Systolic blood pressure between 120-129 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure less than 80 mmHg.
3.	Hypertension:
•	Stage 1: Systolic blood pressure between 130-139 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure between 80-89 mmHg.
•	Stage 2: Systolic blood pressure equal to or greater than 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure equal to or greater than 90 mmHg.
